# QUIC Connection Migration Scanner

This tool is designed to perform QUIC scans for servers to determine if they support the connection migration mechanism. It is based on the [Cloudflare Quiche](https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche) client.

Each scan provides information about:
- The success of the QUIC handshake
- The success of the connection migration
- The HTTP server used (when applicable)
- Eventual errors

## Build

The scanner is coded in Rust. It can be built using the Cargo package manager.

`cargo build --release`

## Usage

The scanner takes as input a list of targets to scan. The list should be a text file with one ip and an optional domain per line. 

There are also several options that can be used:
- -o --output FILE:             Write the results to the specified file (default: out.json)
- -w --wait-headers:            Wait until response headers are received before performing the migration
- -f --fast                     Shutdown the connection as soon as the response headers are received without waiting for the whole response
- --threads N                  Use N threads to perform the scans (default: 100)
- -m --migration-addr ADDRESS   Use the specified source address for the migration
- -i --interface ADDRESS        Use the specified interface for the migration
- t --type TYPE                 Use the specified type of migration. Supported types are: 
    - standard (default): Perform a standard migration, using negotiated CID and path challenge
    - reuseCID: Perform a migration re-using the same CID and sending a path challenge
    - passive: Perform a passive migration, re-using the same CID and not sending a path challenge

 Example:
 ```
 ./migration_checker -o test_output.json -t passive -w --threads 50 test_input.txt
 ```
